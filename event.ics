SUMMARY:Smarter SQL for Data Science [O’Reilly Live Event]
DESCRIPTION:• Understand why SQL remains a powerful tool for the modern age\n• Develop greater fluency in your use of SQL—reduce fiddling\n• Learn how to make use of advanced features of database products such as PostgreSQL\nDo you work with SQL databases? Do you ever write select statements? Have you ever considered the dizzying array of possibilities when writing a select statement to perform a complex analysis?\n\nDo you wish you were more confident when it comes to writing joins\, self joins\, group bys\, window functions\, common table expressions\, recursive common table expressions?\n\nGiven an analysis problem\, do you struggle with the exact features and phrasing you need to solve that problem within a single SQL statement?\n\nIf that sounds like you\, you’re going to want to join us for this comprehensive training on SQL for the modern age!\n\nDisclaimer: This training will include PostgreSQL-specific features & functionality that may not be present in other database products like MariaDB\, MySQL\, or SQLite.\n\nRising to the Challenge of Data Science Series: Data science is more than creating complex models or analyses from data. An effective data scientist must navigate\, normalize\, clean\, analyze\, draw conclusions from\, and communicate their data instead of relying on data engineers (cleaning/storage) or software developers (dashboarding/communication). To become an independent\, full stack data scientist\, it is essential to master all of the skills and mechanics in this series not only to write more robust\, maintainable\, and extensible code\, but also to adequately communicate your results to stakeholders and colleagues\, keeping the message within your own control.\n\nCourses in this series https://learning.oreilly.com/search/?query=author%3A%22James%20Powell%22&extended_publisher_data=true&highlight=true&include_assessments=false&include_case_studies=true&include_courses=true&include_playlists=true&include_collections=true&include_notebooks=true&include_cloud_scenarios=true&include_sandboxes=true&include_scenarios=true&is_academic_institution_account=false&source=user&formats=live%20online%20training&publishers=Pearson&sort=relevance&facet_json=true&json_facets=true&page=0&include_facets=true&include_practice_exams=true:\n\n• Smarter Shell for Data Science\n• Smarter SQL for Data Science\n• Smarter Statistics for Data Science\n• Smarter Dashboarding for Data Science\n• Smarter Pandas for Data Science\n• Smarter Plotting for Data Science\n\nWith James Powell\, Cameron Riddell\n\nClick to view the full event details or join when the event is in session: https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/-/0636920079365/0636920088357/ \n\n
